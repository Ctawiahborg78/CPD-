      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Charles Adomako Tawiah</strong>, a BSc Computer Science student at Nottingham Trent University with a passion for software engineering and cybersecurity. My academic background is complemented by real-world experience through internships with GCHQ, PwC, and Meta’s Elevate program. I’m highly motivated to continue developing both technical and professional skills to prepare for a successful tech career.</p>

    <section id="aspirations" class="section">
      <h2>Career Aspirations & Required Skills</h2>
      <p>I aspire to work as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> or <strong>Cybersecurity Analyst</strong> in a leading tech company, preferably in a hybrid role with international opportunities. These roles require proficiency in languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++, strong problem-solving ability, teamwork, and a deep understanding of secure system design.</p>
      <p>Based on job descriptions from LinkedIn and Bright Network, I identified the following core skills:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL proficiency</li>
        <li>System design and algorithm knowledge</li>
        <li>Understanding of data security practices</li>
        <li>Communication and team collaboration</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Career Research</h3>
      <p>According to a job listing for a Software Engineer role at BT Group, essential requirements include "proficiency in Python or JavaScript, familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), and a collaborative mindset." This confirms the relevance of my current development plan and chosen CPD activities.</p>

      <h3>Development Plan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete a full-stack web development course (MERN or Django)</li>
        <li>Contribute to open-source software via GitHub</li>
        <li>Build and deploy a portfolio web app</li>
        <li>Study toward AWS or CompTIA Security+ certification</li>
      </ul>
